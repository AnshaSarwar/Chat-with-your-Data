****Chat with Your Data**

**Overview:**

"Chat with Your Data" is an interactive chatbot application that leverages LangChain's GPT-3.5 Turbo model and operates as a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, enabling natural language interactions with PDFs. Powered by Gradio for a seamless user interface, this project aims to Q/A by providing an intuitive conversational interface using prompts.

**Usage:**

Ask Questions: Once the PDF is uploaded, you can ask questions or give commands related to the content of the document. For example, you can inquire about specific information, request summaries, or ask for insights.

Interact: Engage in a conversation with the chatbot. It will respond based on the content extracted from the PDF and its understanding of natural language.

Explore Data: Utilize the chatbot to explore the data within your PDF in a conversational manner. You can ask for statistics, trends, or even request visualizations of the data.
